### Project Description
This project is a playful, single page React web application designed to transform procrastination into a delightful, self aware experience for coders. The app leverages the Monaco Editor (the heart of VS Code‚Äôs editing experience) and a custom tracking system to monitor and celebrate anti productivity behaviors with witty, contextual commentary.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Coders are expected to be productive, but what about those legendary moments of procrastination? This app celebrates the art of doing nothing (and undoing everything).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Instead of nudging users to do more, Procrastinator IDE tracks undo churn, UI fiddling, tab switching, and idle time making these ‚Äúfailures‚Äù into entertaining achievements with memes, stats, and cheeky commentary.
