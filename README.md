# [anti-productivity IDE] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [404]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Jasil Faras] - [SCMS School of engineeering and technology]
- Member 2: [Krishna Priya] - [SCMS School of engineeering and technology]

### Project Description
A gloriously unserious single‚Äëpage React playground that treats procrastination like a feature, not a bug. It packs the Monaco Editor‚Äîthe same code engine behind VS Code‚Äîand actually runs code in the browser for instant ‚Äújust-one-more-try‚Äù dopamine hits.

Idle for a moment? Snarky anti‚Äëmotivation quotes pop in to lovingly derail momentum.

Hammer undo/redo? Every wobble is tracked and tallied like a sport.

Flip between tabs? The Page Visibility API spots every focus hop and logs it without judgment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Coders are expected to be productive, but what about those legendary moments of procrastination? This app celebrates the art of doing nothing (and undoing everything).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Instead of nudging users to do more, Procrastinator IDE tracks undo churn, UI fiddling, tab switching, and idle time making these ‚Äúfailures‚Äù into entertaining achievements with memes, stats, and cheeky commentary.
